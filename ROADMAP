This is the unofficial roadmap for l2t_tools.

It does not contain any version information, more just prioritized points of interest.

New features:

  l2t_process
    Add temporal proximity - include lines not only in hit (keywords) but also in temporal proximity (+- 5 min or adjustable, or X entries)
    Plugin: Convert the l2t_find_evil into a plugin.
      Done with a matching plugin.
      Need to write a filter plugin too.
    Plugin: Create a Mathplotlib module/plugin to draw/calculate scatter plots and do that automatically (that is the drawing)
    Add the keyword itself that was matched on and put it in the notes field (change the entry)

  l2t_find_evil
    Incorporate into l2t_process.
