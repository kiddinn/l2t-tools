This is the unofficial roadmap for l2t_tools.

It does not contain any version information, more just prioritized points of interest.

New features:

  l2t_process
    Add the line duplication feature of the older tool.
    Add the potential "timestomp" detection feature of the older version.
    Add temporal proximity - include lines not only in hit (keywords) but also in temporal proximity (+- 5 min or adjustable, or X entries)
    Add the keyword itself that was matched on and put it in the notes field (change the entry)
    Add threading:
      Create a queue that is passed to the merge algorithm, all lines appended to queue.
      Create a single thread for watching the queue.
      Create a thread for each plugin that is being run.
      When an event hits the queue, send the line to each of the plugin threads that are running.
        - Small issues came up during initial implementation, take a closer look at the possibilities.
    Plugin: Create a Mathplotlib module/plugin to draw/calculate scatter plots and do that automatically (that is the drawing)

Stuff missing:
  Unit tests, unit tests and unit tests... ohh did I mention unit tests?
    Nothing gets "officially" released until there is a unit test that tests at least most portion of this code.
