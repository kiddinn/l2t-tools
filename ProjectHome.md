This is a set of tools used to work with the output of log2timeline, see https://code.google.com/p/log2timeline.

For now, this is mostly alpha/beta/experimental releases, but when ready for "prime" time this description will be changed.

So you have been warned... use at own risk, and please if you do, provide feedback/issues/complaints/praises.

First testings of l2t\_process.py are promising though and show considerate speed improvements over the older version, so it should be worth testing out, although it doesn't have nearly as many features as the old version has at this moment in time.
