This is a sad sad README.txt file, however... let's start with the simple:

The wiki should be the most up-to-date documentation: http://code.google.com/p/l2t-tools/w/list

 == Installation ==

The classical python installation.

  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install

That should be it.. as of now, no dependencies (as of yet but please see the Wiki for more
up-to-date list).
